A cool mashup idea is when the brew machine starts brewing, music from spotify, for example will automatically play.

The idea behind this is that since coffee is normally drank in the morning, there is no better morning than to listen to music and drink coffee with it.
Also, by playing music, that will cover up the wait time to actually make the coffee.

An extension could be that while the coffee is brewing, more energetic music is played, and that when brewing is done, calm music is played. This is to
adjust to the situation and making the overall experience for the user better.

Example code:
WoT.produce({
  title: "MusicController",
  actions: {
    playChill: {},
    playEnergetic: {},
    stop: {}
  }
}).then(thing => {
  thing.setActionHandler("playChill", async () => {
    console.log("Playing chill playlist...");
  });

  thing.setActionHandler("playEnergetic", async () => {
    console.log("Playing energetic playlist...");
  });

  thing.setActionHandler("stop", async () => {
    console.log("Stopping music...");
  });

  thing.expose().then(() => console.log("MusicController is ready"));
});
